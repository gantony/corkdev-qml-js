# Cross-platform application development with QML and JavaScript

Slides for my talk at [Corkdev](http://corkdev.io/) meetup on [Tuesday, 11 August 2015](http://www.meetup.com/corkdev-io/events/224256026/).

## Description

This talk will introduce you to Qt Quick, a part of the Qt framework that allows us to build cross-platform mobile and desktop applications, using QML and JavaScript. Without writing a single line of C++ code, we can attain close to native application performance, while allowing developers and designers to work productively.
